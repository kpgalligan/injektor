## Injektor: Minimalist injection library


### Using Injektor

We‚Äôll demonstrate dependency injection using our library by building a coffee maker. 
For complete sample code that you can compile and run, see 
[CoffeeMakerIntegrationTest](/injektor/src/test/kotlin/com/github/lexer/injektor/CoffeeMakerIntegrationTest.kt).

Let's start from defining coffee maker classes:

```kotlin
class CoffeeMaker(val heater: Heater, val pump: Pump, val logger: Logger) {
    fun brew() {
        heater.on()
        pump.pump()
        logger.log("coffee is brewed")
        heater.off()
    }
}

interface Heater {
    fun on()
    fun off()
    fun isHot(): Boolean
}

class ElectricHeater(val logger: Logger) : Heater {
    var isOn = false
    
    override fun on() {      
        logger.log("heater is on")
        isOn = true
    }

    override fun off() {
        logger.log("heater is off")
        isOn = false
    }

    override fun isHot(): Boolean {
        return isOn
    }
}

interface Pump {
    fun pump()
}

class Thermosiphon(val heater: Heater, val logger: Logger) : Pump {
    override fun pump() {
        if (heater.isHot()) {
            logger.log("pump is pumping")
        }
    }
}
```

By default Injektor doesn't know how to resolve any dependency. 
Each dependency should be explicitly declared by implementing `Module` class.

```kotlin
class CoffeeMakerModule : Module() {
    // Think of "resolve()" as a promise that dependency
    // will be satisfied when module will be integrated
    override fun configure() {
        bind<Pump> { Thermosiphon(heater = resolve(), logger = resolve()) }
        bind { CoffeeMaker(heater = resolve(), pump = resolve(), logger = resolve()) }
    }
}

```

By default declared dependency will be resolved as a new instance. 
If you want the same instance of a specific class simply add `asSingleton` 
to the end of your declaration.

```kotlin
class HeaterModule : Module() {
    override fun configure() {
        bind<Heater> { ElectricHeater(logger = resolve()) }.asSingleton()
    }
}
```

You should think of `Modules` as "fancy factories". 
Actual dependency resolution is done by `Kontainer` classes.

`Kontainer` is responsible for dependency resolution and scoping of your singleton instances.

Let's create our root `Kontainer`. In our coffee maker example it will be responsible for 
resolving `Logger` singleton class by adding `LoggerModule`.

```kotlin
val rootContainer = Kontainer.create(modules = LoggerModule())
```

Each `Kontainer` can have single parent container and add multiple modules.
Our coffee maker `Kontainer` will extend root `Kontainer` and 
add `CoffeeMakerModule` and `HeaterModule` modules.

```kotlin
val coffeeContainer = Kontainer.create(rootContainer, CoffeeMakerModule(), HeaterModule())
```

Finally we can resolve our `CoffeMaker` dependency and brew some coffee.

There are two ways to resolve dependencies using `Kontainer`.

First is using `inject()` delegated property. To enable that property in your class it 
should implement `Injectable` interface.

```kotlin
class CoffeeApp : Injectable {
    val logger: Logger by inject()
    val cofferMaker : CoffeeMaker by inject()

    lateinit var coffeeContainer: Kontainer

    fun run(): Logger {
        val rootContainer = Kontainer.create(modules = LoggerModule())
        coffeeContainer = Kontainer.create(rootContainer, CoffeeMakerModule(), HeaterModule())

        cofferMaker.brew()

        return logger
    }

    override fun kontainer(): Kontainer {
        return coffeeContainer
    }
}
```

The second way is directly call `get` method on your `Kontainer` instance

```Kotlin
val coffeeMaker = coffeeContainer.get(CoffeeMaker::class)
// or
val coffeeMaker2 : CoffeeMaker = coffeeContainer.get()
```

That's it folks! Happy ~~brewing~~injecting!
